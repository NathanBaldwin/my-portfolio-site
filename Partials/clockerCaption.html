    Clocker is the tool I wish existed during my time in the nonprofit world. This time-keeping app is designed primarily as a tool to help nonprofits track and analyze volunteerism. Use it to track volunteerism for multiple grant initiatives, client participation in various programs, or employee hours spent on different tasks. Get rid of those trusty time sheets and sign-in clipboards!

    Built using JavaScript, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Express, Passport, Redis, Bootstrap, MongoDB, Mongoose, Sass, Bcrypt, and Lodash.

    I also used WebSockets to enable real-time communication with the Clocker-Mobile and deployed the app via DigitalOcean.
