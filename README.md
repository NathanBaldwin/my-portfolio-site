# My Personal Portfolio Website

As we began the second-half of our curriculum at NSS, which was primarily focused on back-end development, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to continue growing my front-end skills by coding the site from scratch.

Throughout the process, I became familiar with some fun, new technologies such as Angular Animate (to employ animations during Angular UI-Router's state changes), CSS transitions and hover animations, the GreenSock animation library, and ScrollMagic. I also became more familiar with Bootstrap and CSS posistioning techniques.

In order to create the handwriting animation on the 'home' page, I created an SVG graphic in Adobe Illustrator comprised of a path that covered my chosen font. Then I converted the font into a clipping mask over the path and used the GreenSock animation library to 'reveal' this path under the clipping mask.

Even though it's admittedly a bit overkill for this project, I wanted to become more familiar with Angular UI-Router. Thus, I employed UI-Router's view changes and state changes to architect the portfolio section of the site.

I deployed this site via DigitalOcean.

Next, my goal is to make it completely mobile friendly!
