# My Personal Portfolio Website

As we began the second-half of our curriculum at NSS, which was primarily focused on back-end development, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to continue growing my front-end skills. Thus, I decided to code my personal portfolio website from scratch.

Throughout the process, I became familiar with some fun, new technologies such as Angular Animate (to employ animations during Angular UI-Router's state changes), CSS transitions and hover animations, the GreenSock animation library, and ScrollMagic. I also became more familiar with Bootstrap and CSS posistioning techniques.

In order to create the handwriting animation on the 'home' page, I created an SVG graphic in Adobe Illustrator, creating a path that covered the font, and then making the font into a clipping mask over this path. I used GreenSock to animate the 'revealing' of this path under the clipping mask.

Even though it's admittedly a bit overkill for this project, I wanted to become more familiar with Angular UI-Router. Thus, I employed UI-Router's view changes and state changes to architect the portfolio section of the site.

I deployed this site via Digital Ocean using NGINX.

Up next: make it completely mobile friendly!
